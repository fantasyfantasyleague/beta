We need to rework NPCs in game.
Right now we just have Foul Beasts
But I want to have more. Some harder, some easier.
Maybe one very powerful one always spawns? Find a big chunk of stone and put them in the middle so u have to dig to them.
Then throughout the world sprinkle other creatures of varying difficulty.

Enemy NPCs to add:
Easy:
bandit


Medium:
Warg


Hard:
Foul Beast (already exists)
Stone Golem


Very powerful, almost like a boss, should be carrying multiple powerful items:
Ancient Dragon


Based on diffuculty category, they should be holding loot based on value of loot items.
All should have chance to have consumables.
The harder they are the more items they should have. Max 3.
