add the following ranged magic weapons:
They should all have a normal ranged attack like the other ones.
But they are meant to not be as powerful
ALL RANGED
so they can inflict the following effects but without doing massive dmg:
Haunted Bell - 1h has a "curse" action (no dmg) 
Wand of Lethargy - 1h has a "slow" action (no dmg)
Anemic Rod - 2h has a "weaken" action (no dmg)
Grimoire of Gore - 2h can inflict bleed (no dmg)
Frozen Sigil - 1h can freeze a target (no dmg)
Fang-Tipped Wand - 1h has no action but gives holder vampirism 

Also: check to make sure that magic resistance helps against all these weapons and their actions as well as the actions of the existing magic weapons.
