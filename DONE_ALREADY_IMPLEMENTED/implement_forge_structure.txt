New structure: Forge.
I want a way for players to produce their own equipment items.
But only basic ones.
New forge structure.
Maybe the available items would be based on the item value?
So only cheap ones available.
Start with some basic items --> BUT I WANT ABILITY FOR EACH FACTION TO OVERRIDE WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO GIVE SOME UNIQUENESS.
But does give players ability to customize loadouts. Or beef up their warriors more easily.
And maybe doesn't cost anything? Can produce 1 item per turn.
What happens when you produce an item? Producing an item is like buying from a shop, you move an item adjacent to forge and click produce item button then select the item.
