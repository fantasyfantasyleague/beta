Adding a new structure, similar to barracks but for building workers.
Each team should start with a town hall (similar to barracks)
This lets them build workers.
If it is destroyed they can't build any more workers.
Workers can build town halls now. Should be expensive.
Worker can build town hall in adjacent square.
A new town hall means you can build other structures/units in a new location.
So, eg, when producing a new worker you could select the area around the old town hall OR the new one.
